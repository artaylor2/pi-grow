# pi-grow
---
## Summary:
The purpose of Pi-Grow is to provide a flexible framework for building an automated home gardening system.

Individual components inheret from specific types of interfaces and are configured using a YAML formatted configuration file.

The system is being designed with Raspberry Pi in mind, but it built off of CircuitPython libraries with an eye towards support other single-board computers as well.

This is primarily a learning-oriented project so it is likely to evolve and shift over time as interest and areas of study shift as well. 

## Features:
- Simple proof-of-concept with an analog soil moisture sensor running on MCP3008 and a 3.3v relay
- Flexible configuation file system to allow for component configuration

## To-Do:
- ~~Simple proof-of-concept with an analog soil moisture sensor running on MCP3008 and a 3.3v relay~~
- ~~Flexible configuation file system to allow for component configuration~~
- Integration for climate monitoring breakout, water reservoir monitoring, and OLED display components
- Logging system for monitoring system components
- User-friendly GUI for configuring systems
- RPC interface for remote systems management
- Web front-end for monitoring systems on a local network
